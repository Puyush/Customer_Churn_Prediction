In this repository, I have performed the end to end Exploratory Data Analysis, and idenfitied the characteristics of the customers that are more likely to churn, and I have created a model to predict whether a customer will churn or not, and lately, have deployed the model.

I have uploaded the dataset as Telco-Customer-Churn.csv
The Telco customer churn data is a good source of data to predict customer churn, which contains information about a fictional telco company that provided home phone and Internet services to customers. It indicates which customers have left, stayed, or signed up for their service.
