Churn Prediction for Telco Company: A Structured Approach 

I worked on solving a critical business challenge for a fictional telco company that provided home phone and Internet services to customers. The challenge was to predict customer churn, which is the likelihood of customers canceling their subscriptions or leaving the company. This task is crucial for retaining customers, enhancing satisfaction, and ultimately maintaining a healthy bottom line.

1. Data Understanding and Preparation:

Analyzed an imbalanced dataset with 26% churn instances.
Utilized SMOTEENN technique for balancing the dataset, creating a representative training set.

2. Feature Engineering:

Addressed dimensionality and training time concerns.
Applied chi-squared test to identify and eliminate insignificant categorical features.

3. Data Preprocessing:

Ensured uniform feature scales using standard scaling.
Employed One-Hot Encoding to transform categorical variables.

4. Dimensionality Reduction:

Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality while preserving 90% of the variance.

5. Ensemble Modeling and Stacking:

Developed a Multi-Layer Stacking ensemble method.
Hierarchically combined models to correct errors and enhance predictions.
Employed Hyper-Parameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV.

6. Unified Framework:

Created a Machine Learning Pipeline for consistency and reproducibility.
Ensured streamlined project execution and efficiency.

Key Observations and Insights:

1. Customers on one- or two-year contracts tend to churn when Total Charges are higher. Suggested bonus reductions after contract periods.
2. Month-to-Month contracts highly correlate with churn. Strategies to retain customers opting for this contract type are essential.
3. Low churn observed for long-term contracts, subscriptions without internet, and customers engaged for 5+ years.
4. Factors like Gender, PhoneService availability, and multiple lines have minimal impact on churn.

Results and Impact:

Our approach led to the development of a robust churn prediction model, empowering the telco company to identify at-risk customers and target pain points. 
Proactive measures for customer retention and satisfaction were implemented, enhancing the company's competitive position in the telecommunications industry.
This not only addressed the critical challenge of customer churn prediction but also provided actionable insights for the telco company's strategic decisions.
